  - Crystals hold ancient energies... but only those who listen can truly understand
    them.
  - Some say crystals can amplify one's spirit. Others just think they look pretty.
  - Legends tell of a crystal so powerful, it could change fate itself. But who believes
    in legends anymore?
  - You ever just stare into a crystal and wonder if it's staring back?
  - "Different crystals, different powers. But in the end, it\u2019s all just rocks,
    isn\u2019t it?"
